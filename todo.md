# To do

- Color the head instead of enclosing it in some characters.
- Make `execute_pretty_tape : ('a, 'q) t -> int -> int -> unit` with the `int`
  arguments being length of tape and initial head offset.
- Turn `demo/` into `examples/` - a library with each module being an example.
  This will allow Odoc to generate documentation as well. Make `.mli` files for
  the examples. Make `bin/` with an executable `main.ml` that demonstrates one
  of the examples.
- Publish the documentation as a GitHub/GitLab page? Automate this process,
  maybe.
