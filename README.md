# Turing Machines

I'm attempting to implement Turing machines in OCaml, at least to the extent that I understand them (very little).


# Execution

Execute the top-level program using

```bash
dune exec tm
```


# Using as a library

[ Coming soon ]


# Documentation

Run this to generate the documentation through [Odoc](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc)
```bash
dune build @doc
```

You can then find the HTML documentation in
```
./_build/default/_doc/_html/
```

Open `index.html` from that directory to start reading through the documentation.
